# Network Web Simulation
A javascript visualisation/animation of node connections and signal strengths based on distance

The program is derived from network models that showcase graphs of nodes with a vast number of vertices.
I wanted to create a dynamic model that allowed each node to randomly move in any direction and see the effect on
the nodes connection with other nearby nodes, this created a visually appealing animation that shows a web of nodes 
with a vast number of vertices that could prove useful as an animation on a website or other project.

## Possible Adaptations
Possible adaptations include:
- An editable mockup for a network model for a different project by editing certain values and removing motion from nodes
- Could be also used to program enemy AI as it can show enemy vision lines to the player which may or may not be obstructed
by obstacles
